# 🛠️ Local Development Guide

Simple local development setup using a hybrid approach:
- 🐳 **Docker** for infrastructure (Redis, Flower)  
- 🐍 **Native Python** for development (FastAPI, Celery)
- ⚡ **Hot reload** and full debugger support

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Initial setup completed** → See [README](README.md)
- **Docker** → Installed and running

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. One command setup
make dev      # Start development (setup + health check)

# 2. Follow the instructions to start services in separate terminals:
make redis    # Terminal 1: Infrastructure
make celery   # Terminal 2: Background worker  
make api      # Terminal 3: API server
make flower   # Terminal 4: Monitoring (optional)
```

## 🔧 Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
make dev           # Start development (setup + health check)

```

### Services
```bash
make redis         # Start Redis
make celery        # Start Celery worker
make api           # Start FastAPI
make flower        # Start monitoring
```

### Database
```bash
make migrate       # Apply migrations
make makemigration # Create new migration
```

### Utilities

**Common Issues:**
- Docker not running → Start Docker Desktop
- Port conflicts → Check `lsof -i :8080` (or :6379, :5555)
- Missing `.env` → Copy from `.env.example`

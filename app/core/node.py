Node Module

This module defines the foundational Node class that all pipeline nodes inherit from.
It implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern, allowing nodes to process tasks
sequentially and pass results to the next node in the chain.

    Node implements the Chain of Responsibility pattern, serving as the base
    handler for all pipeline processing steps. Each concrete node implementation
    represents a specific processing step in the pipeline chain.

    The Chain of Responsibility pattern is implemented through the process()
    method, which each node uses to:
    1. Receive the task context from the previous node
    2. Perform its specific processing
    3. Pass the updated context to the next node
